<h2 class="heading-medium">How accessible this service is</h2>

<p>
    We know some parts of this website are not fully accessible:
    <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>Users of high contrast mode may find their preferences do not work well with some of the maps and associated features as the map tiles and markers retain their original styling.</li>
        <li>Whilst navigating via keyboard, toggling between list and map view causes loss of keyboard focus. The map markers do not have a visible indication when focused.</li>
        <li>Some downloads are in formats that are not accessible to a screen reader</li>
        <li>Charts are in formats that are not accessible to screen readers</li>
        <li>In third step of detailed comparison, screen reader users are not informed of the some updated information when they make a selection</li>
        <li>In search suggestions, users are redirected to the search result page on selection without being advised of the behaviour before using the component</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>

<h2 class="heading-medium">Technical information about this service's accessibility</h2>

<p>
    The Department for Education is committed to making this service accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.
</p>

<h2 class="heading-medium">Compliance status</h2>
<p>
    This website is partially compliant with the <a rel="external noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA standard, due to the non-compliances and exemptions listed below.
</p>

<h2 class="heading-medium">Non-accessible content</h2>

<p>
    The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.
    <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>Awaiting functionality testing and release</li>
        <li>Functionality works as required by our user base</li>
        <li>We are currently unable to make improvements due to technology limitations</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2 class="heading-medium">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h2>


<h2 class="heading-medium">Disproportionate burden</h2>

<h3 class="heading-small">PDFs and other documents</h3>
<p>
    The PDFs, PowerPoint documents and PNGs of our benchmark charts lack some accessibility as they don’t contain ‘label’ tags.
</p>
<p>
    Currently there is no way for us to add tags to these images. We do supply alternative table views of all information on the site which is fully accessible.
</p>

<h3 class="heading-small">Benchmark charts</h3>
<p>Our benchmark charts lack some accessibility as they don’t contain ‘label’ tags.</p>
<p>Currently there is no way for us to add tags to these images. We do supply alternative table views of all information on the site which is fully accessible. </p>

<h3 class="heading-small">On Input</h3>
<p>
    3.2.2 Changing the setting of any user interface component does not automatically cause a change of context unless the user has been advised of the behaviour before using the component.
</p>
<p>
    This functionality is expected by all users and has been tested well. Therefore there is no current change expected to this.
</p>

<h3 class="heading-small">Focus Order</h3>
<p>
    2.4.3 If a Web page can be navigated sequentially and the navigation sequences affect meaning or operation, focusable components receive focus in an order that preserves meaning and operability.
</p>
<p>
    We are unable to determine an issue with this functionality and so no changes are currently planned.
</p>

<h2 class="heading-medium">What we’re doing to improve accessibility</h2>

<p>Our accessibility improvements are a part of our project delivery. We deal with all findings as soon they are uncovered or reported to us. </p>

<p>
    In all cases we aim to do this by fixing the root problem, if this is not possible we build alternative methods that allow for accessibility.
</p>

    Preparation of this accessibility statement
</h2>

<p>This statement was prepared on 19 February 2021</p>

<p>This website was last tested on 28 January 2021. The test was carried out by an external provider, Digital Accessibility Centre.</p>

<p>The approach we used to decide on a sample of pages to test, was to choose four common usability journeys that took on the majority of touchpoints of the service.</p>
