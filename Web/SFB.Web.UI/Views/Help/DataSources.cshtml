        <p class="govuk-body">
            You should take care when interpreting the data. It shows the position of a school relative to others; it doesn’t explain why this is. There may be good reasons for a school to have high or low figures. What’s important is that those involved in budget setting review the differences, and consider the reasons for them.

        <a class="govuk-link" id="staff-costs"></a>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Staff costs</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">As staffing typically represents between 75% and 80% of mainstream schools’ expenditure, and more for special schools and pupil referral units (PRUs), it’s important that schools review their staff structures regularly as part of their annual school improvement, curriculum and financial planning.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">When you are interrogating other schools’ finances to compare with your own, it’s important to look at the education delivery model as a whole. The data that sits within the workforce tab on the benchmark charts page will help with this.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">It is also useful to have discussions with professionals in other schools in your benchmark set to grain greater insight into the reasons they operate in the way they do and evaluate the suitability of alternative education delivery models to your own situation.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">

        <a class="govuk-link" id="premises-costs"></a>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Premises costs</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">Next to staffing costs, premises costs can be one of the most expensive groups in the costing structure. This cost grouping includes premises staff, cleaning, caretaking, maintenance and improvement, and private finance initiative (PFI) charges.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            It is useful to look at the premises total expenditure as a percentage of total cost in the first instance and consider whether this is significantly higher or lower than others. This can sometimes be explained by the amount of income generated through the hire of the school’s facilities.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            Some components in the premises costs block need to be looked at together. For example, if you have directly employed premises staff members, they often undertake basic maintenance and improvement tasks and this usually brings economies to schools. When comparing maintenance and improvement costs with other schools, it is also wise to look at premises staff costs at the same time.

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Occupation costs</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            It is sensible to look at these as a percentage of the total expenditure for your school.  However, it can also be useful to look at some of these costs related to per pupil. Water and sewerage costs are worth investigating on a per pupil basis as the cost driver here is people.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            Energy costs are more complex. You have to heat the whole school and keep all the infrastructure ticking over all of the time. So an initial view of energy costs on a percentage of the total expenditure is a good starting point. However, if you also look at this cost element on a per pupil basis, it will challenge you as to whether you have the most energy efficient approaches that you could possibly have. It may also challenge you to consider whether you have made the best use of framework agreements to obtain maximum efficiencies from the costs you incur.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            Investment in energy saving improvements can often find medium to long term savings. The government supports an Energy Efficiency Loan Scheme, run by Salix Finance, to help schools meet energy efficiency investment costs.

        <p class="govuk-body">This includes educational supplies, administrative supplies and bought-in professional services.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            If your school doesn’t have adequate and professional services, this can have a direct impact upon pupil outcomes. Educational supplies need to be modern and fit for purpose and schools need to access adequate professional services.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            ICT learning resources spending can sometimes take the form of a refurbishment or refit which will last a few years at least, so it is not possible to expect spending on this costing block to be even across a number of schools.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            You should challenge any spending you have on ICT learning resources and consider whether you are obtaining the greatest efficiencies possible. Ask yourself whether you are procuring jointly with other schools to obtain savings. You might also want to consider the use of framework agreements in order to secure the best possible deals for your school. Spending under this heading should be immediately recognisable as the spending that was planned in your ICT development plan for that year.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            Learning resources are the very essence of your core business. You should evaluate how much of your total expenditure you are devoting to this important cost group. It is also useful to look at this on a per pupil basis and challenge yourself on whether you are spending enough on high quality learning resources. This is another example where benchmarking may challenge you to rebalance the allocations of finance within your expenditure structures, given that spending power is finite.

        <p class="govuk-body">A few schools borrow money or have financing costs through leasing agreements, always with Department for Education/Education and Skills Funding Agency approval.
