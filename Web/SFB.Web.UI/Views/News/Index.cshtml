        <h3 class="heading-small">22 October 2020</h3>
        <p class="mt-1">The 22 October release of the Schools Financial Benchmarking service includes a significant new feature. </p>
        <p>Users can now navigate to a Self-Assessment Dashboard from the individual school page. The dashboard will be familiar to people that have used the Schools Financial Value Standard or SRM Self-Assessment tool in recent years.  </p>
        <p>This dashboard is populated with the latest available information and shows how a school’s data compares to thresholds on a range of statistics that have been identified by the Department for Education (DfE) as indicators of good resource management.</p>
        <p>In addition, a user can perform a side-by-side dashboard comparison by entering locally available data or future forecast information.</p>
        <p>The dashboard can be found under the heading "tools for governors and school business professionals" on the individual school page.</p>

        <p class="mt-2">
            The SFB site has had several improvements to ensure its alignment to GDS Accessibility standards. They include:

                <li>Revised news and guidance panel</li>
                <li>Changed all incidences of the error summary</li>
                <li>Changed link colour</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            The SFB site has revised some of its minor functionality in order to improve the overall performance of the site. This includes:
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul class="govuk-list list-bullet">
                <li>Changed the title on side bar on school page. 'This school's analytics' to 'Tools for governors and school business professionals'</li>
                <li>Removed 'Set as default school' from school page</li>
                <li>On benchmark chart pages changed 'Edit characteristics' to 'Back to school characteristics'</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
