            The 9th November release of the Schools Financial Benchmarking service includes a significant new feature.
        <p>This dashboard is populated with the latest available information and shows how a school’s data compares to thresholds on a range of statistics that have been identified by the Department for Education (DfE) as indicators of good resource management.</p>
        <p>In addition, a user can perform a side-by-side dashboard comparison by entering locally available data or future forecast information.</p>
        <p>The dashboard can be found under the heading "tools for governors and school business professionals" on the individual school page.</p>

        <p class="mt-2">
            The SFB site has had several improvements to ensure its alignment to GDS Accessibility standards. They include:
        </p>        
        <p>
            Users can now navigate to the Efficiency Metric service from the individual school page.
        </p>
        <p>
            The SFB site has also had some of its minor functionality revised in order to improve the overall performance of the site. This includes:
            <ul class="list-bullet">
                <li>Print & Download icons have moved on side by side scenarios</li>
                <li>Efficiency Metric and Self Assessment modals are matching existing School Financial Benchmarking modals</li>
                <li>Downloaded files from the Self Assessment Dashboard have had formatting improvements</li>
                <li>Schools with “The” in the middle of their name have had omissions removed</li>
                <li>Changed the title on side bar on school page. 'This school's analytics' to 'Tools for governors and school business professionals'</li>
                <li>Removed 'Set as default school' from school page</li>
                <li>On benchmark chart pages changed 'Edit characteristics' to 'Back to school characteristics'</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            Further improvements will be added in future releases. You can comment on any changes in your experience by emailing
