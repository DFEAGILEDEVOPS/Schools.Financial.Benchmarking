        <p>
            Local Authority Maintained School data for the period 2018-19 has been added to the Schools Financial Benchmarking service. Thanks to improvements we have made to processing, cleansing and publication, this is 2 months earlier than last year, and 6 months earlier than the previous year. We will continue to look for opportunities to improve our processing and to incrementally reduce the time to publication, improving the usefulness of this data to schools and other users.
